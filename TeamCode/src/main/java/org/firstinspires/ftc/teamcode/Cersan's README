Hello!
I am going to walk you through what every file here is used for.
For collaborators:
please don't change this file unless you add something new to the repo.
Even if you aren't a collaborator, you might wanna read this,
especially if you're forking the repo


First off, RobotDrive
That's all the stuff that needs to be initialized.
You should add this code to any class that deals with driving

Next is csTeleop,
That's the driver-controlled code.
It pulls from many classes to work, so if something breaks,
check all the classes it imports

RobotValues is the constants folder.
Do NOT change it unless something is broken.
If something is broken, save that file before changing it so we have a backup pwease.

HuskyDrive is also driver-controlled, and I'll eventually combine it into csTeleOp
if Itkan gives us a Husky sensor

For SensorHuskyLens, just read the comments.
I think its sample code, not sure tho
don't change it pls

Ditto for ConceptAprilTagEasy

RobotValues is the constants folder.
Do NOT change it unless something is broken.
If something is broken, save that file before changing it so we have a backup pwease.

SimpleLogger is something I don't quite understand yet
VisionControl is what it looks like, all the configs for vision control.
Don't change it please

And that's that for now! Thanks for reading.
